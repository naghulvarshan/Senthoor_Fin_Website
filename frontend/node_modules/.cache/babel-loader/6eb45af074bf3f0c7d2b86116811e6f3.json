There are basically two types of\r\n          interest rates for used car loans – fixed and floating interest rates.\r\n          Whereas the applicable interest rate remains constant throughout the\r\n          loan tenure when you opt for the fixed rate, floating interest rates\r\n          change with market fluctuations. Fixed interest rates on car loans are\r\n          generally higher than floating rates, but the rate that is offered\r\n          also depends on various other factors like the age and credit score of\r\n          the borrower, the amount of money being borrowed, the loan tenure\r\n          chosen, etc.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h1 className='h1'>BENEFITS OF APPLYING FOR A SECOND-HAND CAR LOAN</h1>\r\n        <div className='ngdiv'>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Used cars cost less than new cars, so you can apply for a smaller\r\n            amount as a loan.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>It is easy to get even 95-100% of the car’s value financed.</li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            With minimal documentation and competitive interest rates, a used\r\n            car loan that suits your requirements is easy to find and avail.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>Minimal documentation, quick approvals, and quick disbursals.</li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            With numerous options available online, it is easy to find the best\r\n            features, offers, and interest rates for a used car loan.\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h1 id=\"related\">Related blogs</h1>\r\n      <div className=\"otherblogs\">\r\n        <div className=\"el\">\r\n          <a href=\"b2.html\">\r\n            <img\r\n              src={im2}\r\n              alt=\"used-cars\"\r\n              width=\"200px\"\r\n              height=\"200px\"\r\n            />\r\n            <p className=\"other\">How to get a car loan with bad credit score</p>\r\n          </a>\r\n          <a href=\"b3.html\">\r\n            <img\r\n              src={im3}\r\n              alt=\"used-cars\"\r\n              width=\"200px\"\r\n              height=\"200px\"\r\n            />\r\n            <p className=\"other\">\r\n              Can I get a car loan without having an ITR in india\r\n            </p>\r\n          </a>\r\n          <a href=\"b4.html\">\r\n            <img\r\n              src={im4}\r\n              alt=\"used-cars\"\r\n              width=\"200px\"\r\n              height=\"200px\"\r\n            />\r\n            <p className=\"other\">How to get a car loan with bad credit score</p>\r\n          </a>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default B1;"],"mappings":";AAAA,SAAQA,KAAR,QAAoB,OAApB;AAEA,OAAO,eAAP;AAEA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,eAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,eAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,eAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,eAAhB;;;AAGA,MAAMC,EAAE,GAAC,MAAI;EAET,oBACI;IAAA,wBACI;MAAA,uBACN;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;QAAA,uBACE;UAAK,GAAG,EAAEH,GAAV;UAAe,GAAG,EAAC,QAAnB;UAA4B,SAAS,EAAC,GAAtC;UAA0C,KAAK,EAAC,KAAhD;UAAsD,MAAM,EAAC;QAA7D;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MADF;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IADM;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QADJ,eAMJ;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;MAAA,uBACE;QAAK,EAAE,EAAC,SAAR;QAAA,wBACE;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,IAAd;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAEE;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,GAAb;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFF,eAiBE;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,GAAb;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAjBF,eAqBE;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,IAAd;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QArBF,eAsBE;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,GAAb;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAtBF,eAqCE;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,IAAd;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QArCF,eAsCE;UAAG,SAAS,EAAC,GAAb;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAtCF,eAmDE;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,IAAd;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAnDF,eAoDE;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAf;UAAA,uBACA;YAAA,wBACE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAKE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QALF,eAME;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QANF,eAUE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAVF,eAWE;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAXF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QApDF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IADF;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QANI,eA+EJ;MAAA,wBACE;QAAI,EAAE,EAAC,SAAP;QAAA;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADF,eAEE;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,YAAf;QAAA,uBACE;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,IAAf;UAAA,wBACE;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,SAAR;YAAA,wBACE;cACE,GAAG,EAAEA,GADP;cAEE,GAAG,EAAC,WAFN;cAGE,KAAK,EAAC,OAHR;cAIE,MAAM,EAAC;YAJT;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAOE;cAAG,SAAS,EAAC,OAAb;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAPF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QADF,eAUE;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,SAAR;YAAA,wBACE;cACE,GAAG,EAAEC,GADP;cAEE,GAAG,EAAC,WAFN;cAGE,KAAK,EAAC,OAHR;cAIE,MAAM,EAAC;YAJT;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAOE;cAAG,SAAS,EAAC,OAAb;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAPF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAVF,eAqBE;YAAG,IAAI,EAAC,SAAR;YAAA,wBACE;cACE,GAAG,EAAEC,GADP;cAEE,GAAG,EAAC,WAFN;cAGE,KAAK,EAAC,OAHR;cAIE,MAAM,EAAC;YAJT;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADF,eAOE;cAAG,SAAS,EAAC,OAAb;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QAPF;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QArBF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA;MADF;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAFF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QA/EI;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADJ;AAuHH,CAzHD;;KAAMC,E;AA4HN,eAAeA,EAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
