For\r\n          being able to choose low commercial vehicle loan interest rates or\r\n          flexible payment and tenure options, one should ideally put in their\r\n          own research to look around for the right types of commercial vehicle\r\n          loans. Another instance where you will need to put in some effort to\r\n          find the best option is when you need to avail a loan for a used\r\n          commercial vehicle. There is no manufacturer directly involved here\r\n          and you cannot depend on the availability of default loan options\r\n          either.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h1>DOCUMENTATION FOR A COMMERCIAL LOAN</h1>\r\n        <p>\r\n          If you are applying for a commercial loan, documentation will mainly\r\n          include:\r\n        </p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>Filled application form with photograph</li>\r\n          <li>2 passport-size photographs</li>\r\n          <li>A cheque for the processing fee</li>\r\n          <li>KYC documents</li>\r\n          <li>Income proof</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <h1>KYC DOCUMENTS</h1>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Age proof (any one of these): Aadhaar card, PAN card, voter’s ID,\r\n            passport, driving license.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            ID proof (any one of these): Aadhaar card, voter’s ID, passport,\r\n            driving license.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Proof of residence (any one of these): Rent agreement, passport,\r\n            voter’s ID, ration card, utility bill, sales tax certificate, trade\r\n            license.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            For signature verification (any one of these): Driving license, PAN\r\n            card, government ID card (for govt. employees), registered sale\r\n            deed.\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <h1>\r\n          SOME IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLE FINANCE THAT YOU SHOULD\r\n          KNOW ABOUT\r\n        </h1>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <strong>Your Credit History:</strong> Unlike most loans, commercial\r\n            loans do not require a credit score and history check for the\r\n            applicants.\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            <strong>Processing Charges:</strong> Lenders charge a small\r\n            non-refundable amount as a processing fee for the loan.
